ebotula - IRC management bot
----------------------------

Ebotula is an IRC-bot taking charge of basic tasks. It can be used to
manage one or more channels. Management includes:

	- automatic setting and saving of user permissions after login
	- setting and saving of channel modes
	- setting and saving of channel topic
	- setting and displaying of channel greeting
	- setting and removing of ban masks
	- creating of user accounts
	- joining/parting of/from channels
	- broadcast messages without IRC operator rights
	- displaying of user lists
	- stopping the bot
	- restarting the bot

An online help for the bot is also included. It includes a list of all commands
known to the bot as well as detailed discription for every command. The
information that can be displayed depends on the permissions the asking user has.

The bot saves his data (e.g. channel topic, user permissions etc.) in seperate
files. So these data can be restored after restarting the bot. The login state
is also saved in these files but reseted after restart. Zombie logins will be
logged out automatically as long as the bot is running. Accounts not being used
for a certain time are removed by the bot. The time after which this happens can
be configured.

The bot is running as a multi thread application so it can process multiple
commands at the same time. The number of used threads (equivalent to the number
of commands which can be processed parallel) can be configured. This way the
bot is able to manage multiple channels at the same time and react to numerous
commands send by numerous users parallel.

All settings and configuration are done in the file ebotula.conf, usually
located in /usr/local/etc/. All command line parameters given will overwrite
the settings in the config file.

For more information and changes see the files NEWS,ChangLog, INSTALL, BUGS
and TODO.

The bot is being released under the terms of the GNU General Public License GPL.
