<P>
If you have problems with GNU <CODE>dbm</CODE> or think you've found a bug,
please report it. Before reporting a bug, make sure you've actually
found a real bug. Carefully reread the documentation and see if it
really says you can do what you're trying to do. If it's not clear
whether you should be able to do something or not, report that too; it's
a bug in the documentation!

</P>
<P>
Before reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it
to the smallest possible input file that reproduces the problem. Then
send us the input file and the exact results <CODE>gdbm</CODE> gave you. Also
say what you expected to occur; this will help us decide whether the
problem was really in the documentation.

</P>
<P>
Once you've got a precise problem, send e-mail to:

UUCP: <TT>`mit-eddie!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-utils'</TT>.

<P>
Please include the version number of GNU <CODE>dbm</CODE> you are using. You can get
this information by printing the variable <CODE>gdbm_version</CODE> (see Variables).

</P>
<P>
Non-bug suggestions are always welcome as well. If you have questions
about things that are unclear in the documentation or are just obscure
features, please report them too.
