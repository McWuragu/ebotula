@PACKAGE@.conf \- Configuration file for IRC bot @PACKAGE@
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I @PACKAGE@.conf
is the configuration file for the IRC bot 
.IR @PACKAGE@(1) .
It is usally placed in /etc. If you want to use another configuration
file, you can do so by giving @PACKAGE@ the parameter -f <name_of_conf_file>
when you start it. In @PACKAGE@.conf the default values of the parameters
for @PACKAGE@ are set. The command line parameters are prior to options
set in the config file, so any command line parameter will overwrite the value
taken from this config file. The Hash (#) is used as comment sign, i.e.
everything from this sign to the end of line is ignored.
