<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="gdbm_toc.html#TOC4">Opening the database.</A></H1>

<P>
Initialize <CODE>gdbm</CODE> system. If the file has a size of zero bytes, a file
initialization procedure is performed, setting up the initial structure in the
file.

</P>
<P>
The procedure for opening a <CODE>gdbm</CODE> file is:

</P>

<PRE>
GDBM_FILE dbf;

dbf = gdbm_open(name, block_size, flags, mode, fatal_func);
</PRE>

<P>
The parameters are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>char *name
<DD>
The name of the file (the complete name, <CODE>gdbm</CODE> does not append any
characters to this name).
<DT>int block_size
<DD>
It is used during initialization to determine the size of various constructs. It
is the size of a single transfer from disk to memory. This parameter is ignored
if the file has been previously initialized. The minimum size is 512.
If the value is less than 512, the file system blocksize is used, otherwise the
value of <CODE>block_size</CODE> is used.
<DT>int flags
<DD>
If <CODE>flags</CODE> is set to GDBM_READER, the user wants to just read the
database and any call to <CODE>gdbm_store</CODE> or <CODE>gdbm_delete</CODE> will fail.
Many readers can access the database at the same time. If <CODE>flags</CODE> is
set to GDBM_WRITER, the user wants both read and write access to the database
and requires exclusive access. If <CODE>flags</CODE> is set to GDBM_WRCREAT, the
user wants both read and write access to the database and if the database does
not exist, create a new one. If <CODE>flags</CODE> is set to GDBM_NEWDB, the
user want a new database created, regardless of whether one existed, and wants
read and write access to the new database.  For all writers (GDBM_WRITER,
GDBM_WRCREAT and GDBM_NEWDB) the value GDBM_FAST can be added to the 
<CODE>flags</CODE> field using logical or.  This option causes <CODE>gdbm</CODE>
to write the database without any disk file synchronization.  This allows 
faster writes, but may produce an inconsistent database in the event of
abnormal termination of the writer.
Any error detected will cause a
return value of NULL and an appropriate value will be in <CODE>gdbm_errno</CODE> (see
Variables). If no errors occur, a pointer to the <CODE>gdbm</CODE> file descriptor
will be returned.
<DT>int mode
<DD>
File mode (see chmod(2) and open(2) if the file is created).
<DT>void (*fatal_func) ()
<DD>
A function for <CODE>gdbm</CODE> to call if it detects a fatal error. The only
parameter of this function is a string. If the value of NULL is provided,
<CODE>gdbm</CODE> will use a default function.
</DL>

<P>
The return value, <CODE>dbf</CODE>, is the pointer needed by all other functions to
access that <CODE>gdbm</CODE> file. If the return is the NULL pointer,
<CODE>gdbm_open</CODE> was not successful. The errors can be found in
<CODE>gdbm_errno</CODE> for <CODE>gdbm</CODE> errors and in <CODE>errno</CODE> for file system
errors (for error codes, see <CODE>gdbm.h</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
In all of the following calls, the parameter <CODE>dbf</CODE> refers to the pointer
returned from <CODE>gdbm_open</CODE>.
