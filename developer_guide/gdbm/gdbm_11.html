<H1><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="gdbm_toc.html#TOC11">Database Synchronization</A></H1>

<P>
If your database was opened with the GDBM_FAST flag, <CODE>gdbm</CODE> does not
wait for writes to the disk to complete before continuing.  This allows
faster writing of databases at the risk of having a corrupted database if
the application terminates in an abnormal fashion.  The following function
allows the programmer to make sure the disk version of the 
database has been completely updated with all changes to the current time.

</P>

<PRE>
gdbm_sync(dbf);
</PRE>

<P>
The parameter is:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>GDBM_FILE dbf
<DD>
The pointer returned by <CODE>gdbm_open</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
This would usually be called after a complete set of changes have been
made to the database and before some long waiting time.
<CODE>gdbm_close</CODE> automatically calls the equivalent of <CODE>gdbm_sync</CODE>
so no call is needed if the database is to be closed immediately after
the set of changes have been made.
