Using this command you get one. Your login is the nickname you had when
sending this command. REMEMBER to set a password with !pass.

Identify yourself to the bot. Any user who has got an account, must identify
himself before bot commands are accepted. This is done by this command.

your passwd!

e.g.: /msg @PACKAGE@ fooname foobar
.TP
\fB!invite\fP <#channel> [nickname]
Invites the user in a channel. If a channel is set invite\-only, you can only
join this channel if a user in it asks you to (invites you). So if only the
