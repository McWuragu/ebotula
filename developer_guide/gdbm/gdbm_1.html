<P>
This library is <STRONG>free</STRONG>; this means that everyone is free to use
it and free to redistribute it on a free basis.  GNU <CODE>dbm</CODE> (<CODE>gdbm</CODE>)
is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there
are restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are
designed to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want
to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further
sharing any version of <CODE>gdbm</CODE> that they might get from
you.
</P>
<P>
  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies <CODE>gdbm</CODE>, that you receive
source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these
functions or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.
</P>
<P>
  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies <CODE>gdbm</CODE>, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
</P>
<P>
  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for anything in the <CODE>gdbm</CODE> distribution.
If these functions are modified by someone else and passed on, we want
their recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed,
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on our
reputation.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>gdbm</CODE> is currently distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, Version 2.  (<EM>NOT</EM> under the GNU General Library
Public License.)  A copy the GNU General Public License is included with
the distribution of <CODE>gdbm</CODE>.
