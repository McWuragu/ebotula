<H1><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="gdbm_toc.html#TOC9">Sequential access to records.</A></H1>

<P>
The next two functions allow for accessing all items in the database. This
access is not <CODE>key</CODE> sequential, but it is guaranteed to visit every
<CODE>key</CODE> in the database once. The order has to do with the hash values.
<CODE>gdbm_firstkey</CODE> starts the visit of all keys in the database.
<CODE>gdbm_nextkey</CODE> finds and reads the next entry in the hash structure for
<CODE>dbf</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
key = gdbm_firstkey(dbf);

nextkey = gdbm_nextkey(dbf, key);
</PRE>

<P>
The parameters are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>GDBM_FILE dbf
<DD>
The pointer returned by <CODE>gdbm_open</CODE>.
<DT>datum <CODE>key</CODE>
<DD>
<DT>datum nextkey
<DD>
The <CODE>key</CODE> data.
</DL>

<P>
The return values are both datum. If <CODE>key</CODE>.dptr or nextkey.dptr is NULL,
there is no first <CODE>key</CODE> or next <CODE>key</CODE>. Again notice that dptr points to
data allocated by malloc and <CODE>gdbm</CODE> will not free it for you.

</P>
<P>
These functions were intended to visit the database in read-only algorithms,
for instance, to validate the database or similar operations.

</P>
<P>
File <CODE>visiting</CODE> is based on a <CODE>hash table</CODE>. <CODE>gdbm_delete</CODE>
re-arranges the hash table to make sure that any collisions in the table do not
leave some item <CODE>un-findable</CODE>. The original key order is NOT guaranteed to
remain unchanged in ALL instances. It is possible that some key will not be
visited if a loop like the following is executed:

</P>

<PRE>
   key = gdbm_firstkey ( dbf );
   while ( key.dptr ) {
      nextkey = gdbm_nextkey ( dbf, key );
      if ( some condition ) {
         gdbm_delete ( dbf, key );
         free ( key.dptr );
      }
      key = nextkey;
   }
