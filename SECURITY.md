## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue or have concerns regarding security, please report it to us by emailing [laube.steffen@gmx.de](mailto:laube.steffen@gmx.de). Provide as many details as possible to assist us in assessing and addressing the problem.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers of the project are responsible for responding to reported security issues, evaluating them, and taking appropriate actions to resolve the problem. The process for responding to security issues is as follows:

1. **Issue Confirmation:** The maintainer will review and confirm the reported issue.
2. **Communication:** The reporter will be kept informed of the progress of the resolution.
3. **Resolution:** The maintainer will address the problem as quickly as possible and release a new version of the code.
4. **Disclosure:** Upon resolving the issue, a security update will be released.

## Disclosure of Security Issues

We strive to handle security issues responsibly and set timelines for disclosure that match the scope of the problem. Typically, we release security updates concurrently with issue resolution. We kindly request holding off on public disclosure of security issues until a solution is provided.

## Updates and Revisions

This security policy may be updated to reflect changes in how security issues are handled in the project. Users are encouraged to periodically review this policy.

Thank you for contributing to enhancing the security of the ebotula project.
